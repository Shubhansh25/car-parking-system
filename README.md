The parking system entrance has a sensor that detects incoming vehicles. Once the sensor is triggered, the gate requires a password to open.
If the entered password is correct, the gate will open and allow the vehicle to enter. If the password is incorrect, the gate will remain locked.
If a car is already inside the car park and another car arrives at the entrance, the door will be locked and require the incoming car to enter a password
untill the other car exits, which is detected by the exit sensor.
